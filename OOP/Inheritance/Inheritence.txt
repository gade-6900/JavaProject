inheritance means trasfrom properties from one class 
to another class its called inherotance the superclass 
provide properties to subclass 

there are type of inheritance 
1. single level :- in single level one super class and one subclas are present
ex: ---
    class Animal {
        void eat() {
            System.out.println("Eating...");
        }
    }

    class Dog extends Animal {
        void bark() {
            System.out.println("Barking...");
        }
    }

2. multi-level inheritance:- multi level inheritance means there are one superclass 
and one class inherite from another class.
ex:-  
    class Grandparent {
        void wealth() {
            System.out.println("Grandparent's wealth");
        }
    }

    class Parent extends Grandparent {
        void property() {
            System.out.println("Parent's property");
        }
    }

    class Child extends Parent {
        void toys() {
            System.out.println("Child's toys");
        }
    }


3. Hierarchical Inheritance:- multiple sublasses inherite from one superclass ..
    class Vehicle {
        void start() {
            System.out.println("Vehicle started");
        }
    }

    class Car extends Vehicle {
        void drive() {
            System.out.println("Car driving");
        }
    }

    class Bike extends Vehicle {
        void ride() {
            System.out.println("Bike riding");
        }
    }
